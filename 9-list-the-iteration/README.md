# List: Iteration

This document provides a detailed summary of the key concepts and lessons I learned while exploring iteration in Python. Iteration allows us to loop through lists and other iterable objects, enabling us to perform operations on their elements. Below is a breakdown of the topics covered and the insights gained.

---

## 1. Iteration with the `for` Loop
File: [iteration-with-the-for-loop.py](9-list-the-iteration/iteration-with-the-for-loop.py)

The `for` loop allows us to iterate over elements in a list or string. I learned how to process each element and perform operations like summing numbers or calculating string lengths.

```python
numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10]
total = 0

for number in numbers:
    total += number
print(total)  # Output: 27
```

---

## 2. Iteration with Conditional Logic
File: [iteration-with-conditional-logic.py](9-list-the-iteration/iteration-with-conditional-logic.py)

I learned how to combine iteration with conditional logic to filter or process elements based on specific criteria.

```python
def odd_sum(numbers):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 1:
            total_sum += number
    return total_sum

print(odd_sum([3, 6, 9, 12, 15]))  # Output: 27
```

---

## 3. Iterating in Reverse with the `reversed` Function
File: [iterate-in-reverse-with-the-reversed-function.py](9-list-the-iteration/iterate-in-reverse-with-the-reversed-function.py)

I explored two ways to iterate over a list in reverse order: slicing with `[::-1]` and using the `reversed()` function.

```python
the_simpsons = ["Homer", "Marge", "Bart", "Lisa", "Maggie"]

for character in reversed(the_simpsons):
    print(character)
# Output: Maggie, Lisa, Bart, Marge, Homer
```

---

## 4. The `enumerate` Function
File: [the-enumerate-function.py](9-list-the-iteration/the-enumerate-function.py)

The `enumerate` function allows us to iterate over a list while keeping track of the index of each element.

```python
errands = ["Go to the gym", "Grab lunch", "Get promoted at work"]

for index, task in enumerate(errands, 1):
    print(f"{task} is number {index} on my list!")
# Output: Go to the gym is number 1 on my list!
```

---

## 5. The `range` Function
File: [the-range-function.py](9-list-the-iteration/the-range-function.py)

The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used for iteration. I learned how to specify start, stop, and step values.

```python
for number in range(10, 101, 10):
    print(number)
# Output: 10, 20, 30, ..., 100
```

---

## 6. The `break` Keyword
File: [the-break-keyword.py](9-list-the-iteration/the-break-keyword.py)

The `break` keyword allows us to exit a loop prematurely when a specific condition is met.

```python
def contains(values, target):
    for value in values:
        if value == target:
            return True
    return False

print(contains([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: True
```

---

## 7. The `continue` Keyword
File: [the-continue-keyword.py](9-list-the-iteration/the-continue-keyword.py)

The `continue` keyword skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one.

```python
def sum_of_positive_numbers(values):
    total = 0
    for value in values:
        if value < 0:
            continue
        total += value
    return total

print(sum_of_positive_numbers([1, 2, -3, 4]))  # Output: 7
```

---

## 8. Command-Line Arguments with `sys.argv`
File: [command-line-arguments-with-argv.py](9-list-the-iteration/command-line-arguments-with-argv.py)

I learned how to use the `sys.argv` list to access command-line arguments passed to a Python script.

```python
import sys

word_lengths = 0
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    word_lengths += len(arg)

print(f"The total length of all command-line arguments is {word_lengths}")
```

---

## 9. Practice Problems
File: [assignment.py](9-list-the-iteration/assignment.py)

This section focuses on solving practical problems using iteration. Below are the functions I implemented:

### 9.1. Sum of String Lengths
I created a function to calculate the total length of all strings in a list.

```python
def sum_of_lengths(words):
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total

print(sum_of_lengths(["hello", "Bob"]))  # Output: 8
```

---

### 9.2. Product of Numbers
I wrote a function to calculate the product of all numbers in a list.

```python
def product(numbers):
    total_product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        total_product *= number
    return total_product

print(product([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
```

---

### 9.3. Smallest Number
I implemented a function to find the smallest number in a list.

```python
def smallest_number(numbers):
    lowest_number = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number < lowest_number:
            lowest_number = number
    return lowest_number

print(smallest_number([3, 2, 1]))  # Output: 1
```

---

### 9.4. Concatenate Strings with Length > 2
I created a function to concatenate all strings in a list that have more than 2 characters.

```python
def concatenate(words):
    result = ""
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 2:
            result += word
    return result

print(concatenate(["abc", "de", "fgh"]))  # Output: abcfgh
```

---

### 9.5. Sum of Index Positions of "s"
I wrote a function to sum the index positions of the first occurrence of the letter "s" in each string in a list.

```python
def super_sum(words):
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        if "s" in word:
            total += word.index("s")
    return total

print(super_sum(["mustache", "pessimist"]))  # Output: 3
```

---

### 9.6. Find Index of a String in a List
I implemented a function to find the index of a target string in a list. If the string is not found, it returns `-1`.

```python
def in_list(strings, target):
    for index, element in enumerate(strings):
        if element == target:
            return index
    return -1

print(in_list(["enchanted", "sparks fly"], "sparks fly"))  # Output: 1
```

---

### 9.7. Sum of Values and Indices
I created a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a list along with their index values.

```python
def sum_of_values_and_indices(numbers):
    total = 0
    for index, number in enumerate(numbers):
        total += index + number
    return total

print(sum_of_values_and_indices([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 9
```

---

## Summary

- Combining iteration with conditional logic.
- Leveraging built-in functions like `enumerate`, `range`, and `reversed`.
- Using `break` and `continue` to control loop execution.
- Solving practical problems using iteration.
