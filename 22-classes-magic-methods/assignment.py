#  Coding Exercise - Equality and String Representation


# Declare a BusTrip class that accepts destination, bus_company, and price parameters.
# - During initialization, assign these parameters to attributes of the same names.

# Define a string representation for the class:
# - The string representation must follow this format:
#   "You paid 24.99 to Greyhound to go to Boston."
# - Replace the example values with the respective attributes for the object.

# Implement equality logic for BusTrip objects:
# - Two BusTrip objects are considered equal if:
#   - They have the same destination.
#   - They have the same bus_company.
#   - Their price is within 3 dollars of each other.

# Coding Exercise Custom Indexing and Iteration

# and year (number) parameters and assigns them to respective
# attributes.

# Define a Dealership class. Each Dealership object should instantiate
# with a "cars" attribute set to an empty list.

# that accepts a Car object and adds it to the Dealership's internal
# "cars" list.

# Indexing into a Dealership with a number should access a specific
# Car object in the Dealership.

# An index position in a Dealership should also be overwritable
# with a new Car object (see examples below).
